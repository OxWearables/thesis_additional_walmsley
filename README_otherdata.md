# Data in other folders 

Many of the analyses here use data that has already been processed elsewhere. 

This describes the source of that data. 

Anything from `input_loc` ("../../paperRW2021") is as made in the [main project](https://github.com/OxWearables/manuscript_ml_behaviours_cvd_2021).

Anything from `input_loc_rm` ("../repeatedMeasurementsStudy") is as made in data processing for the project with the repeated measurements data (ambition to eventually incorporate data processing into this study directly).

Anything from `file_loc` is functions from the `repeatedMeasurements` [private R package](https://github.com/OxWearables/repeatedMeasurements).
